# FlipJump C++ Interpreter

This project is a very fast [FlipJump](https://github.com/tomhea/flip-jump) interpreter, and supports the 0,1,2 fjm versions.

FlipJump is the simplest programing language.<br>
Yet, it can do **any modern computation**.

It's an Esoteric language ([FlipJump esolangs page](https://esolangs.org/wiki/FlipJump)), with just 1 operation `a;b`:
- `not *a; jump b`

Which means - **Flip** a bit, then **Jump**.

# How to run

Simply compile and run:

```bash
>>> fji hello.fjm -s
Hello, World!
```

- The -s flag is used to not print times and running-statistics.
